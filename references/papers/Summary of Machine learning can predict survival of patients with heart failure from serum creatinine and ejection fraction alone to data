Problem Statement: 
  The paper addresses the early and accurate diagnosis of COVID-19. It reviews the techniquies used to acheive successful COVID-19 screening,
  namely using the method called deep forest. The performance of the proposed deep forest model has an accuracy of about 99%, comparable to other well established 
  machine learning techniques.


Dataset Used: 
  Two different datasets were used. The first is publicly accessible; and this set had 5644 patient records from March 2020 to April 2020 in 
  Sao Paulo Brazil. This dataset contains cliical tests inclusing blood, urine, SARS-CoV-2, and rt-PCR test. The second dataset was retrevied from San 
  Raffaele Hospital in Milan, Italy. It contained 279 patients which age, gender, blood tests, and so on.

Methodologies Used:

  Two publicly available COVID-19 datasets containing routine blood test data were used for training
  Deep Forest algorithm was chosen instread of nueral network because of smaller dataset and low computational cost.
  DF uses extra trees, XGBoost, LightGBM. These work together to enhances model accuraacy.

Findings:

  Deep forest model acheived 99.5% afccuracy, 95.28% sensitivty, 99.96% specificty in diagnosing COVID-19
  Fast, cost effeciant alternative to PCR test
  Model was reliable enough for screening patients.

Relevance to Project: 
  This research provides us with the outlook to inqure about DF approach. Additionally, it provides us with possible methods to train the model.
